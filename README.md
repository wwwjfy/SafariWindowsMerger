SafariWindowsMerger
===================

The ability of Safari to do windows/tabs operations is weak.

This bundle is a helper to finish simple operations via shortcuts.

- `Ctrl + Shift + M`: merge latest two windows into one.

- `Ctrl + Shift + N`: move current and next tabs to a new window.

- `Shift + Alt + Command + [`: move the current tab left.

- `Shift + Alt + Command + ]`: move the current tab right.

- `Command + 9`: go to last tab.
